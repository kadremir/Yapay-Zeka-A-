This is my AI lesson homework, but I've made a few improvements and uploaded it here for further updates.

First, you'll need a Linux distribution of your choice. It doesn't matter which one, as long as you're able to set up Ollama. For more details on how to do this, you can visit the Ollama website. While Ollama can also be used on Windows, I'm not familiar with the setup process on that platform, but perhaps you know other methods.

Second, before running the code, you need to install a few Python libraries. However, I'm not sure how to create a requirements.txt file because I'm still a beginner, not a pro.

Third, sometimes the program fails to connect to the terminal. To avoid this, make sure to run the model you'll be using first. This involves starting the terminal before executing the code. Once the code runs, you should select the model you used from the model selection menu.

After completing these steps, you can use the program.
